# Note: Wallet address, chain ID, and contract addresses are hardcoded in src/lib/constants.ts
# This keeps the demo consistent and prevents configuration drift.
# For production deployment, consider moving these to environment variables if you need
# to deploy to different networks or use different contract addresses.
